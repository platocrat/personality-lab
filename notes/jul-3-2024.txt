To-dos:
1. Social rating game
    1. Copy Kahoot's gamified UI of a 4-question style of "Do You Want To Be A Millionaire?" 
        1. Focus on the game's layout
        2. Bare essential game mechanics are:
            1. Each user gets a score that is calculated as the difference between the their score and the target's real score
                2. For example, `user_score = (100 - Math.abs(real_score - guessed_score))`, where we subtract the difference from 100 to get the user's score so that the `user_score` increases to 100 the smaller the difference, or the closer the user's guess is, to the target's `real_score`.
            2. There are 3 rounds per game (could allow admins to changes `rounds` as a future "game setting")
    2. Game-quiz structure
        1. The Kahoot-style quiz of each game simply asks a shortened version of the total personality assessment's questions. 
            1. For example, the 45- or 25-question version of the BESSI will be used for the game instead of the full version with 192 questions.
            2. This means that each question should feel mostly the same to when responding to the assessment's questions outside of the game, for example on the `/assessments/` for `study` and `non-study` based assessments.
    3. Fictional and/or Pop-culture characters
        1. Use AI to generate personality profiles of pop-culture/fictional characters (e.g. Einstein, The Big Bang Theory, Euphoria, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, etc.)
        2. Let users rate the pop-culture/fictional characters
        3. Let users compare their own personality profiles to the profiles of the pop-culture/fictional characters
3. Use real data for the Profile page
4. Use real data for the BESSI Histograms
